## Create a new Funding Program

Navigate to **Funding > Add Funding Program**. This directs to a form where you can enter the basic values of the program:

* **Title**: The title of the funding program. It is possible to add a long title here.
*  **Abbreviation**: A short abbreviation of the program title.
* **Identifier Prefix**: The identifier of a funding case within this funding program will start with the given prefix.
* **Start Date**: The start date of the funding program.
* **End Date**: The end date of the funding program.
* **Requests Start Date**: The start date of the application process.
* **Requests End Date**: The end date of the application process.
* **Currency**: The currency for the budget.
* **Budget**: The amount of money that the giving organisation can distribute across the various funding requests.
* **Funding Case Type**: The type of this funding program. The available case types are
  * Sonstige Aktivit√§t (AVK1)
  * Internationale Jugendbegegnung
  * Sammelantrag Kurs

The dates **Start** and **End** are meant for the time span in which the money is given. The dates **Requests Start Date** and **Requests End Date** refer to the time span in which new applications can be made. In most situations, the application process ends before the distribution of money starts, i.e. `Requests Start Date < Requests End Date < Start Date < End Date`.

After creating the funding program, you will be redirected to a page that allows you to take further actions. It is recommended to [edit the funding program permissions](todo:add link) via **Actions > Edit permissions** before closing this page. Otherwise, you might not have enough permissions and not find the newly created funding program in the funding program overview.

## Edit Funding Programs

An overview of funding programs can be found at **Funding > Funding Programs**. It lists all funding programs for which the current CiviCRM user has viewing permissions.
