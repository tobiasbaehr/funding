# Usage

The user experience of the funding framework depends in detail on the funding case type that is selected for the funding program. As described [here](../administration/necessary-adjustments.md), organizations that want to use the funding framework should define their own funding case type.

This chapter is based on the funding case type _Sonstige Aktivit√§t_ (AVK1).
