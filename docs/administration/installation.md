# Installation

The installation described below assumes that CiviCRM and the funding portal run on the same Drupal and that Drupal is installed with composer. It is also possible to install the funding portal on a separate Drupal instance. In this case, the instructions have to be adapted accordingly.

The funding extension is still under development and there exists no stable release yet.

In the following, `$DRUPAL_ROOT` refers to the Drupal installation root, for example `/var/www/web`.

## Status of this Document

The status of this document is **work in progress**.

The installation instructions were used on a system with

- CiviCRM 5.67.3
- Drupal 10.1.6
- PHP 8.1

## Configure Upload of Private Files

```bash
mkdir $DRUPAL_ROOT/drupal/web/sites/default/files/private
chmod g+w $DRUPAL_ROOT/drupal/web/sites/default/files/private
```

Grant read and write permissions for the directory `private` to the webserver user.

Set the following setting in `$DRUPAL_ROOT/drupal/web/sites/default/settings.php`:

```php
$settings['file_private_path'] = 'sites/default/files/private';
```

## Drupal Modules and Dependencies

Edit `$DRUPAL_ROOT/drupal/composer.json` and add the following to repositories:

```
        "json_forms": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:systopia/drupal-json_forms.git"
        },
        "custom/civiremote_funding": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:systopia/drupal-civiremote_funding.git"
        },
        "custom/civiremote": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:systopia/civiremote.git"
        },
```

Open a terminal at `$DRUPAL_ROOT` and enter

```bash
composer require custom/civiremote_funding
drush pm:enable civiremote_funding
```

## Further Modules/Dependencies

- `fontawesome` is not required if Font Awesome is provided by other means.
- `formtips` is not required, but recommended.
- `symfony/property-access` is a dependency of the funding extension.

```
composer require drupal/fontawesome drupal/formtips symfony/property-access
drush pm:enable fontawesome formtips
```

Enter this command, so that changes to views etc. can be applied:

```
composer require drupal/config_update
drush pm:enable config_update
```

The last step is no longer necessary as soon as we have releases of `civiremote_funding` with update routines.

### Configure Fontawesome

You can optionally change the settings to provide Font Awesome files locally:

```
drush fa:download
```

Open `/admin/config/content/fontawesome` and uncheck the option **Use external file (CDN) / local file?**


### Configure Formtips

Set the following under `/admin/config/user-interface/formtips` (adjust times if necessary):

```
Trigger Action: Hover
Selector: :not(#funding-form *)
Interval: 100
Timeout: 100
```

The above selector restricts the module to the funding forms.

## Install CiviCRM Extensions

Install the following extensions, use the newest release if not otherwise indicated:

- [de.systopia.xcm](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm)
- [de.systopia.identitytracker](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.identitytracker) - version >= 1.4
- [de.systopia.remotetools](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.remotetools)
- [de.systopia.civioffice](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.civioffice) - version >= 1.0
- [org.project60.banking](https://github.com/Project60/org.project60.banking) - version >= 1.0. The  _CiviContribute_ component needs to be activated for this extension.
- [activity-entity](https://github.com/systopia/activity-entity)
- [external-file](https://github.com/systopia/external-file)
- [funding](https://github.com/systopia/funding)

## Configure CiviOffice

See [https://docs.civicrm.org/civioffice/en/latest/](https://docs.civicrm.org/civioffice/en/latest/).

The option **Use PHPWord macros for token replacement** needs to be activated.

## Configure CiviRemote

- Activate **Acquire CiviRemote ID** at `/admin/config/services/civiremote.` with Parameter mapping: **Email** â†’ **email**
- Activate the option **Remote Contact Matching Enabled** at `/civicrm/admin/remotetools`.

## Configure CiviMRF

Set up an API User:

- add a role **CiviCRM API** with the following permissions:
    - AuthX: Authenticate to services with API key
    - CiviCRM: access CiviCRM Backend und API
    - CiviCRM: remote access to Funding Program Manager
    - CiviCRM: view debug output
    - RemoteContacts: match and link
    - RemoteContacts: retrieve
- add a Drupal user **api** with the role **CiviCRM API**
- generate an [API key](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/api-keys/) for the corresponding CiviCRM contact **api**

Set up a CiviMRF profile under `/admin/config/cmrf/profiles` or edit the default profile:

- The Site Key can be found in your civicrm.settings.php
- Insert the API Key you just created.

[Optional] Activate **CiviMRF Call Report** at `/admin/modules`.
This helps with debugging by showing a report about all API calls sent to CiviCRM and the corresponding results. The report can be found at `admin/reports/cmrfcalls`.

## Synchronise User Roles

CiviRemote will synchronise permissions that are set for a CiviCRM contact with the associated user in Drupal. For the funding framework, the roles **CiviRemote: CiviRemote User** and **CiviRemote: CiviRemote Funding** are used. During the synchronisation of user roles, these roles are automatically created in Drupal if they don't exist yet. Because of this, we create a test user, synchronise/create the roles and delete the user afterward. You can also create a regular user that you would need to create anyway.

- Create a new user **Test User** in Drupal
- Open the associated CiviCRM Contact, scroll down in the summary page and edit the custom field set **RemoteContact Information**. Add the two roles **CiviRemote User** and **CiviRemote Funding**.
- Open the user list of Drupal (`admin/people`) and select the test user you created
- Perform the action **CiviRemote: Match contacts** and afterward **CiviRemote: Synchronise CiviRemote Roles**

You should now see the roles listed for the test user. You can delete the test user if you don't need it anymore.
For any other users you create, the roles selected in CiviCRM at **RemoteContact Information** will be automatically synchronised during the login of that user.

Additionally, you need to adapt the permissions for Drupal user roles as described [here](./user-permissions.md#drupal-permissions).

## Configure Dashboard

Open the basic site settings at `admin/config/system/site-information` and enter `/civiremote/funding` in the field for the default front page.

## Create Templates

The creation of transfer contracts and payment instructions relies on templates in `docx` format. They are created with [CiviOffice](https://docs.civicrm.org/civioffice/en/latest/) and can contain tokens. Currently, there is no admin page available to upload the template files.

### Transfer Contract Template

Copy the template file to a temporary location (e.g. `/tmp/transfer-contract-template.docx`). Determine the ID of the funding case type.

```shell
cv cli civicrm_api3('Attachment', 'create', [
  'name' => "transfer-contract-template.docx",
  'mime_type' => "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
  'entity_id' => {FUNDING_CASE_TYPE_ID},
  'entity_table' => "civicrm_funding_case_type",
  'options' => ['move-file' => "/tmp/transfer-contract-template.docx"],
]);

exit
```
Set the `file_type_id` (not possible with Attachment API):

```shell
cv api4 File.update +v file_type_id:name=transfer_contract_template +w 'id = {FILE_ID}'
```

### Payment Instruction Template

Copy the template file to a temporary location (e.g. `/tmp/payment-instruction-template.docx`). Determine the ID of the funding case type.

```cv cli```

in the following prompt you can enter

```shell
civicrm_api3('Attachment', 'create', [
  'name' => "payment-instruction-template.docx",
  'mime_type' => "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
  'entity_id' => "{FUNDING_CASE_TYPE_ID}",
  'entity_table' => "civicrm_funding_case_type",
  'options' => ['move-file' => "/tmp/payment-instruction-template.docx"],
]);

exit
```
Set the `file_type_id` (not possible with Attachment API):

```shell
cv api4 File.update +v file_type_id:name=funding_payment_instruction_template +w 'id = {FILE_ID}'
```

## Time Zone

All requests must be executed with the same time zone. This means that all
CiviCRM contacts must use the same time zone. Therefore, the option
`Users may set their own time zone` in the Drupal `Regional settings`
(`/admin/config/regional/settings`) needs to be disabled.
